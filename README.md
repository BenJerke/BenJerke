### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, this is Ben. I'm in the process to changing careers from healthcare IT to software development. I've made a few attempts before, but aborted each time due to financial reasons. Now I'm fortunate enough to be in a spot where time and money aren't as tight. I'm committed to making this change so I can give myself a career that will allow me to be more flexible in where I can live and work, and in what types of projects I work on. I want to make things, and I want those things to be cool and useful.
