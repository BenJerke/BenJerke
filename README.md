## Hello everyone! 
I'm Ben! My pronouns are he/him, and I live in Columbus, Ohio. I build web apps, databases, and scripts to solve problems and have fun. I like Java, JavaScript, Python, and C#; and I want to learn Kotlin and Rust. 
My current project is a portfolio website that I've just containerized with Docker. I'm planning to deploy it to a Digital Ocean droplet, which I'd like to use for hosting other fun stuff too! 
Once that's done, I want to update my Sudoku project so that it can run on the web (and maybe support multiplayer). 

I'm currently looking for work. If you'd like to hire me, that's fantastic! My LinkedIn profile is [here!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjerke614/)
If you'd like to collaborate on a project, I'd like that too! You can e-mail me at benj427@gmail.com - but please follow me on here first, so's I know who you are. 

Have a great day, and good luck with whatever you're working on!
